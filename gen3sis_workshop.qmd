This workshop is designed to provide foundational knowledge on how to use gen3sis for various research questions, which is crucial for defining models within the modeling cycle. The course will briefly introduce the philosophical context of natural science and the principles of mechanistic models. 
Participants will engage in hands-on exercises, applying gen3sis to explore hypotheses concerning the genesis and maintenance of biodiversity within the R programming environment. Practical experiences will equip attendees with the necessary background to craft their own biodiversity models. 
The workshop mainly uses simulated data, leading to valuable insights about the interplay between processes and patterns in biodiversity research.
Please bring a laptop equipped with R and the latest version of gen3sis to participate effectively. For those eager to maximize their workshop experience, I recommend reading the [methods paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001340) and exploring this [repo](https://github.com/ohagen/DispDiv3) which includes some of the materials (such as landscapes and configuration files) we'll be using. The related article is forthcoming and currently in press.

## Introduction

Welcome to the workshop on `gen3sis`, an R package designed for simulating ecological e evolutionary dynamics over time and space. In this workshop, we will:

1.  Set up the R environment
2.  Understand the basics
3.  Run a basic simulation
4.  Customize simulations
5.  Troubleshoot

## 1. Setting up the R environment

We'll need the `gen3sis` R-package along with configuration and landscapes from this [repo](https://github.com/ohagen/DispDiv3). Please download the repo and create a new R script in the same directory. There you can copy and paste the code from the sections bellow and for your convenience use [myscrip.R](myscript.R)

```{r}
# install and load gen3sis
require(gen3sis)
# get package version
print(paste("gen3sis version:", packageVersion("gen3sis")))
# package here robust simple path management
require(here)
# we will also use terra for landscape visualization
require(terra)
# package ape used for plotting phylogenies
require(ape)
```

To access the landscape and configuration files, please download the necessary materials from this Dropbox folder. For faster simulation speeds, place the distances_full folder inside the space folder, alongside the distances_local folder.

Get the landscape and configuration files. If you don't like waiting and would like your simulations to run faster, download this [dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/lzxzee5hi0cqiu6tglmgk/AFrnEBV83Sd6tdo1Kdc-m7g?rlkey=9a49gsorhikzvt6f4oibjdtkj&dl=0) and place it, i.e. the *distances_full* folder, inside the *space* folder along side the *distances_local* folder.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
here::i_am("gen3sis_workshop.qmd")
```

```{r}
# set path to directory containing the landscape
landscape_dir <- here("space")
# look at folder structure
list.files(landscape_dir)
# set path to config_file
config_file <- here("config/config_simple.R")
```

## 2. Understanding the basics

Gen3sis is an engine that simulates eco-evolutionary processes at the population level. It utilizes a landscape containing environmental variables that evolve over time, alongside a configuration file housing the eco-evolutionary rules. Read more [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001340)

### 2.1 Landscape

![This tutorial utilizes a theoretical archipelago system. Each site 1x1 km, features temperature (i.e. mean, minimum and maximum temperature) and has a landscape structure that is generated by approximating topography, uplift dynamics, and lapse rate. Additionally, it incorporates global temperature and sea level changes dating back to the past 5 million years (Ma).](https://github.com/ohagen/DispDiv3/raw/main/figures/AnimationS1_patch_dynamics.gif)

```{r}
# load landscapes
lc <- readRDS(file.path(landscape_dir,"landscapes.rds"))
# class(lc) "list"
# get names of landscape variables
names(lc)
# get first time step
first_step_pos <- ncol(lc$mean_temp)
first_step <- colnames(lc$mean_temp)[first_step_pos]
# get first 10 sites of mean temperature for the 2 last time steps and the first (oldest) time step
lc$mean_temp[100:110, c(1:4, first_step_pos)]
# plot mean_temp for first and last time step
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(r_first <- rast(lc$mean_temp[ ,c("x", "y", first_step)], type="xyz"), main="first")
plot(r_last <- rast(lc$mean_temp[ ,c("x", "y", "0")], type="xyz"), main="last")
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # set it back
```

🏋💻 **Exercise** [max 10 min] 
Create a way to visualize the last 100 time steps of this gen3sis input. If possible think of abstracting for any x,y,z1,z2,z3... temporal data-frame. If possible, try to make a function.

<details>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# solution 1
for (ti in 100:0) {
  ri <- rast(lc$elevation[,c("x", "y", as.character(ti))], type="xyz")
  plot(ri, main=paste(ti/100, "Ma")) # divide by 100 to get Ma since 1 time-step =10 kyr
  Sys.sleep(0.1)
}
# solution 2
# define animation function
plot_landenv <-  function(df, times=100:0, reverse=F, speed=0.1){
  # df is a data frame with x, y coordinates and time steps as columns with environmental variables
  # reverse is a boolean. Reverse the order of time steps?
  # times is either a vector of time steps or a character "all"
  # speed in seconds
  #df <- lc$temp
  if (times[1]=="all"){
   times <- names(df)[!names(df)%in%c("x", "y")] 
  }
  if (reverse){
    times <- rev(times)
  }
  for (ti in times){
    ri <- rast(df[,c("x", "y", ti)], type="xyz")
    plot(ri, main=paste(as.numeric(ti)/100, "Ma"))
    Sys.sleep(speed)
  }
}
# call animation function
plot_landenv(lc$elevation, times=c(100:0), speed=0.1)
# example of plotting entire time series
# plot_landenv(lc$min_temp, times="all", reverse=T, speed=0.03)

```
</details>
</div>

### 2.2 Config

Open this config file in Rstudio or any text editor to see the rules that will be applied to the landscape.

```{r}  
# load config
cf <- create_input_config(config_file = here("config/config_simple.R"))
# list all main elements of the config file
names(cf$gen3sis)
# list all elements of the general section, i.e. the main settings and not so much on the eco-evolutionary processes
names(cf$gen3sis$general)
```

<div style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1px;">
🏋💻 **Exercise** [max 10 min] 
Open the config file config_simple and go though the eco-evolutionary rules that will be applied to the landscape.
<details>
<strong>Settings</strong>

We start our simulation at the latest avaiable time, i.e. 5Ma, which corresponds to time step 500 since 1 time-step = 10 kyr. We end it a the latest available time-step. Sometimes, simulations can go forever, to avoid this we limit the maximum total number of species alive in a simulation to 50000 with max_number_of_species and the maximum number of species within one site to 20000 with max_number_of_coexisting_species. This stops and flags simulations that generate too many species (time constrain). We define which traits we will consider in our simulation with traits_names, in our example, species have a dispersal ability a optimum temperature and a temperature width trait.

<strong>Observer</strong>

The observer function saves and plot changes (real-time during model execution) over time in the conditions of the virtual world (biotic and abiotic) by saving custom information at designated time steps.

<strong>Initialization</strong>

The create_ancestor_species function creates the first specie(s) in the simulation. In this case, we create one species spread across all avaiable sites with low dispersal ability, optimum temperature at 20 degrees C and a temperature width (+-1).


<strong> Dispersal </strong>

The dispersal function iterates over all species populations and determines the connectivity between sites, crucial for trait evolution and specialization, as well as the colonization of new sites. In our example, species dispersal is stochastic and uniform across all species. I.e. an exponential distribution with the rate denominator as the dispersal trait value.

<strong> Speciation </strong>

The speciation iterates over every species separately, registers populations’ geographic occupancy (species range), and determines when geographic isolation between population clusters is higher than a user-defined threshold, triggering a lineage splitting event of cladogenesis. The clustering of occupied sites is based on the species’ dispersal capacity and the landscape connection costs. Over time, disconnected clusters gradually accumulate incompatibility, analogous to genetic differentiation. When the divergence between clusters is above the speciation threshold, those clusters become two or more distinct species, and a divergence matrix reset follows. On the other hand, if geographic clusters come into secondary contact before the speciation occurs, they coalesce and incompatibilities are gradually reduced to zero.


<strong>Evolution</strong>

Think of it as trait evolution. Clustered populations (exchanging genes) have their trait homogenized. If weighted by abundance a trait of a population that is doing well in a site, as dictated by the ecology function, will contribute more to the average trait of a cluster. Populations mutate based on a normal distribution with standard deviation 0.001, possibly increasing or decreasing species optimum temperature.

<strong> Ecology </strong>

The ecology function determines the abundance or presence of the populations in occupied sites of each species. The function iterates over all occupied sites and updates the species population abundances or presences on the basis of local environmental values, updated co-occurrence patterns and species traits. In this example we use only presence/absence data, i.e. abundances 0 or 1.

## 3. Run a basic simulation

It's time to run a simulation, we use the config_simple and archipelago system we are familiar with and set verbose to 2 in order to get more information on the progress of the simulation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# run simulation
sim <- run_simulation(config = here("config/config_simple.R"), 
                      landscape = here("space"), 
                      output_directory = here("output"))
```

On sim we store the simulation output summary, while most of the information and large data is/should be stored in the output directory according to the observer function. If you don't want to run the simulation, you can load the sim object from the repo.

```{r}
sim <- readRDS(here("output/config_simple/sgen3sis.rds"))
```


In addition to the simulation output summary, we include a flag indicating whether the simulation completed successfully or the criteria for stopping, such as an excessive number of species. This section also provides system information and simulation-specific parameters.

```{r}
#check elements inside the sim object
names(sim)

# visualize the outputs
plot_summary(sim)

# plot richness from summary in custom fashion
na_mask <- is.na(lc$elevation[,"0"])
rich <- sim$summary$`richness-final`
rich[na_mask,3] <- NA
plot(rast(rich, type="xyz"), col=c("grey", gen3sis::color_richness_non_CVDCBP(max(rich, na.rm=T))), main="Richness")


# plot richness at time step 32 using saved data
sps32 <- readRDS(here("output/config_simple/species/species_t_32.rds"))
lc32 <- readRDS(here("output/config_simple/landscapes/landscape_t_32.rds"))
plot_richness(sps32, lc32)

```

Beyond the custom storage mediated over the observer function, we have a standard phylogeny stored as phy.nex as well as a copy of the config used for the simulation.

```{r}
phy <- read.nexus(file.path(here("output/config_simple/phy.nex")))
plot(phy)
```

<div style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1px;">
🏋💻 **Exercise** [max 2 min] 
Think of 3 ways to change extinction rates?
</div>

## 4. Customize simulations

For an example of a more complex simulation, with species abundances, traits trading off and evolving check the config_M2_TH.R.

We will modify it so that allopatric speciation is faster.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
conf <- create_input_config(here("config/config_M2_TH.R"))
conf$gen3sis$speciation$divergence_threshold = 30
```

We will also change the observer function to save the presence/absence matrix for each time step.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
conf$gen3sis$general$end_of_timestep_observer = function(data, vars, config){
  plot_richness(data$all_species, data$landscape)
  # make p/a matrices
  out_dir <- config$directories$output
  if(!file.exists(file.path(out_dir,"occs"))){
    dir.create(file.path(out_dir, "occs"))
    }
  # cell names
  all_cells <- rownames(data$landscape$coordinates)
  # get 0 for absence and 1 for presence in each grid cell
  asp <- do.call(cbind,
                 lapply(data$all_species, FUN = function(x) {
                   ifelse(all_cells %in% names(x$abundance), 1, 0)
                  }))
  # colnames are species names
  colnames(asp ) <- unlist(lapply(data$all_species, function(x){x$id}))
  # column bind with x/y coordinates
  presence_absence_matrix <- cbind(data$landscape$coordinates, asp)
  saveRDS(presence_absence_matrix, 
          file=file.path(out_dir,"occs", paste0("pa_t_",vars$ti, ".rds")))
}
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
simod <- run_simulation(config=conf, 
                      landscape=here("space"), 
                      output_directory=tempdir())


```

The dynamics is different from the simple simulation, with more species and a some extinction events.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_summary(readRDS(here("output/config_M2_TH_mod/sgen3sis.rds")))
plot(read.nexus(file.path(here("output/config_M2_TH_mod/phy.nex"))))
```

<div style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1px;">

🏋💻 **Exercise** [15 min] 
Review the config_M2_TH.R file and try to understand what it's doing. Consider how you might modify the configuration or apply it to a specific research question.

## 5. Troubleshoot

Creating or modifying a gen3sis configuration can definitely lead to some weird errors, especially since it's so flexible. That's the downside, along with the steep learning curve. But if you're not too overwhelmed, you're doing great!

Here are some handy debugging tips for when you run into those pesky errors:

browser(): This function lets you pause the execution and explore what's going on. It's like a pit stop where you can check out variables and step through the code.

To make your R session enter browser mode whenever you hit an error, you can use: *options(error = recover)*. This will help you diagnose and fix issues more easily.

You can also condition browser calls, which is very useful when you want to stop execution at a specific time step or when a certain condition is met. Here's an example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Use 'stop_time' to halt execution at a specific timestep in the landscape object:
stop_time <- "62"

get_dispersal_values <- function(n, species, landscape, config) {
    if (landscape$timestep == stop_time) {
        browser()
    }

    # You can also check the 'vars' object for the current timestep:
    vars <- dynGet("vars", inherits = TRUE)
    if (vars$ti == stop_time) {
        browser()
    }
}
```
